The number of employees in each of the small or medium businesses in the

2. What are the difference between value type and reference type variables? What is
boxing and unboxing? 
solution a : value type would directly hold the value and reference type would will hold the momory address or reference for the value 
            : value type are stored in stack memory but reference types are stored in heap memory
            : value type will not be collected by a garbage collector but reference type will be collected by garbage collector
            : value type will be created by struct or enum while reference type will be created by class, interface ,delegate or array
            : value type cant accept null values but reference type can store null value  
           b :  boxing : it convert value type to reference type/object type 
                int i = 15;
                object o = i; //boxing 
                int j  = (int) o ; // unboxing 
                unboxing : convert reference type/object type to value type

 3. What is meant by the terms managed resource and unmanaged resource in .NET
 solution : managed resources are objects whoes memory and lifecycle are automatically managed by .NET community while unmanaged resource are thoes whoes memory and lifecycle are not managed by .net community

4. Whats the purpose of Garbage Collector in .NET?
 The garbage collector manages the allocation and release of memory for an application. 
  garbage collector only work on heap memory, once we have object that has no reference it would be collected by garbage collection . 
it will work on reference type, it divides the memory into three generation generation 0,1 and 2
