
1. What happens when you divide an int variable by 0?
Ans: it causes a System.DivideByZeroException error as integer division by zero is undefined.

2. What happens when you divide a double variable by 0?
Ans: it results in Infinity 

3. What happens when you overflow an int variable, that is, set it to a value beyond its
range?
Ans: It will take the minimum or maximum value of the int datatype.

4. What is the difference between x = y++; and x = ++y;?
Ans: Post-increment: The value of y is assigned to x, and then y is incremented by 1.
Pre-increment: y is incremented by 1, and then the new value of y is assigned to x.

5. What is the difference between break, continue, and return when used inside a loop
statement?
Ans: 
break: Immediately exits the loop, regardless of whether the loop condition is still true. Control moves to the first statement after the loop.
continue: Skips the rest of the current iteration and jumps directly to the next iteration of the loop.
return: Exits the entire method (not just the loop) and returns control to the caller. If the method has a return type, a value must be returned.

 What are the three parts of a for statement and which of them are required?
Ans:
Initialization, Condition, and Iteration.
None of them are required, but the two semicolons (;) must still be there to keep the correct format.

7. What is the difference between the = and == operators?
Ans:

= (Assignment operator): Puts the value on the right into the variable on the left.

== (Equality operator): Checks if two values are the same. Returns true if they are equal, otherwise false.

8. Does the following statement compile? for ( ; true; ) ;
Ans:
Yes, it compiles.
This is an infinite loop because the condition is always true. There's no body, so it just loops forever doing nothing.

9. What does the underscore _ represent in a switch expression?
Ans:
The underscore _ is used as the default case in a switch expression.
It matches any value that hasnâ€™t been matched by earlier cases.
In C# switch statements, we use default: instead. _ is only for switch expressions.

10. What interface must an object implement to be enumerated over by using the foreach statement?
Ans:
The object must implement the IEnumerable interface to work with the foreach loop.
